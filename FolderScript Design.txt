Available ideas:
Zipping and unzipping, execute external program with arguments,

Example:
i0(l(a[0],$)){?(n(i0)=a[1]){d(i0)}}

iterates through files in the first argument and all
subdirectories and if the file's name is equal to the
second argument, the file is deleted


i0(l(a[0],0)){o(i0+"\r",a[1]),o(i0+"\r",$)};

lists all files in a folder given by the first argument
and writes it to a file given by the second argument and
outputs the file to the console

i0(l(a[0],$)){Pa}
