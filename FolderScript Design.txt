n()		name

f()		is file		f(a[0])
v()		is available

c(,)	copy		c(a[0], #path)
m(,)	move		^Doubles as a rename funtion^
d()		delete
l(,)	list		l(a[0], 3) ^Functions as sorting for array variables. Second input is how to sort the array; 0: by variable type and size (utilizing s() function), 1: by alpha-numeric value^
w(,)	write		w("Text to add", a[0])
r()		read		#text = r(a[0])
g()		gen MD5		g(a[0])

s()		size		s(l(a[0], $)) ^if you do of a number it will return the absolute value fx: size(-21) will return 21^

u(,,)	substring	u(#text, #from, #to)
q()		random		q(5) ^Gives either a random whole number between 0 and the input number, a random item of a given array, a random file or folder in a given folder, or a random letter in a given piece of text^

z()		sleep		z(1000) ^sleeps for 1 second^
x()		exit		x(0)
o(,)	options		o(0,1) ^Changes an option in the options table. 0 is debug mode, 1 is overwrite allowed, 2 list on folders return sub-folders instead of files, 3 restrict arrays to only one type of data^

Available letters:
jk
Available symbols:
';.@
Available ideas:
Zipping and unzipping, execute external program with arguments (fx with @), custom methods (fx with .0, .1, .2 system)

Example:
i0(l(a[0],$)){?(n(i0)=a[1]){d(i0)}}

iterates through files in the first argument and all
subdirectories and if the file's name is equal to the
second argument, the file is deleted


i0(l(a[0],0)){w(i0+"\r",a[1]),w(i0+"\r",$)};

lists all files in a folder given by the first argument
and writes it to a file given by the second argument and
outputs the file to the console
